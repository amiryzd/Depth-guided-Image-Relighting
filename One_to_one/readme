############################## PREREQUISITE ##################################
To correctly run the test model, the following packages are required.
1. python 3.6.11 or higher.
2. PyTorch 1.6.0
3. OpenCV.
4.Kornia
5.Pillow
6.scipy

################################# TO-RUN-TESTING #####################################
Navigate to the downloaded folder, in terminal, type:
	python test.py --cuda --model dense121

where --cuda option is for using GPU if available

#################################FILES######################################
1. test.py: 
The file includes the test code for our proposed network.
Parser arguments: 
	--cuda (default = True) for running on the GPU to reproduce the submitted results, 
	--model (default = "dense121") specifies the model being tested, 
	--dataset (default="test_set") for the testset path.
	
Return: running time and the saving path for results.

2. model:
Folder that includes the saved pretrained model.
	(1) dense121.pth: the pretrained model for our proposed network.

3. dense121.py:
The network structure for our "OIDD" model.

4.main.py:
Training code

5.Ligh_estimation.py:
light estimation network architecture

6. dataset.py: 
File that contains the class for reading the dataset that is generated by the 'dataset_generation' folder.

7. dataset_generation:
Folder that contains al the files needed to generate the H5 file for training and some auxilary codes needed for test.

8. test_set: 
The folder includes the test images from NTIRE 21 one-to-one Depth guided relighting Challenge.

9. results:
Folder that contains the output of the two proposed networks.

10. utils.py, common.py:
Files that contain some auxilary functions and classes that are needed during training and/or testing.
